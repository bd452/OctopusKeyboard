Todo octopus: 
-----------------
- switching dicts when switching keyboards
- a way to disable octopus when you switch to a different language keyboard
- put font size to preferences?
- Prefs: new option "Learn From Incoming Messages" (some people may not want it learn from Messages)
- Prefs: option to select max numbers of suggestions (someone wanted to show only 3)
- Long words leak outside the screen
- Think: What to do when maximum of learned user words is reached? after the maximum user words count is stored it should replace the oldest (less frequntly used words) instead of just not storing new words (Luke Christodoulou)
- Pluralization for other langs like Spanish
- Idea: more sources to learn words from (mails? notes?)
- user dictionary editing UI (mainly for deleting words)a
- bug: Problem completing @ (maybe even #?) for some reason
- Don't store numbers in the dictionary (don't complete numbers)!
- overlay cut problem https://twitter.com/NavehIDL/status/334363671939665920/photo/1 (iphone 5 6.1.2 non-pre version)
- sometimes not reloading suggestions? :-O https://twitter.com/NavehIDL/status/334364024324124673/photo/1 (iphone 5 6.1.2 non-pre version)
- minor: proximity suggestions doesn't work on non-latin keyboards
- integrate processing stats (how long one request took)
- potential incompatibility: BiteSMS with SwipeShiftCaret: when using QuckReply after waking the device, it crashes??
- new option: add "Add Space After Completion" default on
- potential bug: "written text in bold" does not do anything? (Tyler_Zyco)
- potential bug: "when automatic learning is off it still learns new words" (Nurgeldy Mugayev)
- doesn't work in any 3rd-party web browser???
- do not block kana or other Japanese keyboard (Japanese,Korean,Chinese) - must be disabled for these keyboards!
- bug: when typing fast, some characters are ignored
- bug: hitting backspace does not always update suggestions 
- bug: german keyboard problems (suggestions at wrong places) https://twitter.com/hinterfragt/status/220246228410171392/photo/1/large 
- option to switch up and down swipes
- bitesms quick reply, (messages+?), ikeywi (https://twitter.com/niino093/status/220531690647470080/photo/1), swipeselection, bitesms, twitkafly and noteme compatibility
- hitting space after the swipe could insert a period?
- bug: after a hashtag (# and @) it gives corrections which replaces # with a word!
- swipeselection compatibility (discuss this with )
- vyresit problem cookies + chrome as default. Maybe allow them to run website but warn that it may not work antil they enable cookies
- pluralization for other langs like Spanish
- screenshot for web
- I found that octopus, even disabled, inteferes with my natural typing speed on the ipad
- clearer font for non-retina devices
- unconfirmed: UITextField placeholders does not clear Placeholder when started typing - e.g. in iMessage
- unconfirmed: Passcode lock keyboard problem
- doublespace "." shortcut problem?
- integrate iOS autocorrect
- feature: Feature: Implement swipe left to delete word(s)?

Low pri
---------
- crashes with smileys?
- when moving cursor before a word, completing a suggestion replaces the word instead of inserting a new one.
- do not suggest one-character words?
- when the space pressed explicitly, don't remove that space on "dot".
- long words may leak outside the screen
- when swiping up on a key without suggestion, insert a space (configurable)
- more suggestions for a single key are not used (but are limited with max suggestions)
