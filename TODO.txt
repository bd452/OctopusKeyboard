Low pri
---------
- crashes with smileys?
- editing user dictionary
- Only load German dic./suggestions w.German keyboard
- when moving cursor before a word, completing a suggestion replaces the word instead of inserting a new one.
- do not suggest one-character words?
- when the space pressed explicitly, don't remove that space on "dot".
- long words may leak outside the screen
- when swiping up on a key without suggestion, insert a space (configurable)
- more suggestions for a single key are not used (but are limited with max suggestions)
- after the maximum user words count is stored it should replace the oldest (less frequntly used words) instead of just not storing new words (Luke Christodoulou) 


Config options octopus 
---------------------------
- backspace deleting whole completion or last character and then whole word
